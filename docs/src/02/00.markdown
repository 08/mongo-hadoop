Getting Started
===============

To get started with MongoDB + Hadoop, you'll need a few things:

* A MongoDB Installation (*mongo-hadoop* supports all MongoDB configurations including Sharding)
* A working Hadoop Installation (a list of supported Hadoop distributions & versions is provided later in this document)
* A basic understanding of how to work with Hadoop and Java projects.
